## Question 1: Explain what is the difference between Weak & Unowned?  

Ans:  
| Feature           |  weak                                   | unowned                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Ownership**    | Does **not** increase reference count   | Does **not** increase reference count         |
| **Optionality**  | Must be declared as **optional (?)**    | Declared as **non-optional**                  |
| **Nil after dealloc**    | Becomes **nil** when object is deallocated  | **Crashes** if accessed after deallocation        |
| **Use Case**  |When the reference can **become nil**  | When the reference should **never be nil**                 |
| **Safety**  |Safe (ARC sets it to nil)  | Unsafe (can lead to runtime crash)                |  

**‚úÖ When to Use Which?**  

**Use weak when:**  

  You expect the referenced object might be deallocated.  
  **Example**: Delegates (delegate pattern), closures capturing self.  

**Use unowned when**:  

  You know the referenced object will always exist as long as the referencing object exists.  
  Example: In closures where self is guaranteed to outlive the closure.  

  **üß† First, What Happens in a Network Call?**  
  
      When you make a network request (e.g., using URLSession or a custom API manager), you often pass a closure to handle the response.  
      That closure might capture self (usually a ViewController) to update the UI once data is received.  

**‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem: Retain Cycle**  

    If you capture self strongly inside the closure, and the closure is retained by the network manager, you create a retain cycle:  
    

**ViewController** ‚Üí **retains** ‚Üí **NetworkManager**  
**NetworkManager** ‚Üí **retains** ‚Üí **closure**  
**closure** ‚Üí **retains** ‚Üí **ViewController**  
This means the ViewController won‚Äôt be deallocated, even if the user navigates away  


**‚úÖ Scenario 1: Using weak self ‚Äî When View Can Be Deallocated**  

**üß† Example: Network Call in a ViewController**  
```swift
class ProfileViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        fetchProfile()
    }

    func fetchProfile() {
        NetworkManager.shared.getProfile { [weak self] profile in
            self?.updateUI(with: profile)
        }
    }

    func updateUI(with profile: Profile) {
        // update labels, images, etc.
    }
}
```
**üîç What Happens Here?**  

      User opens ProfileViewController.  
      A network call starts.  
      Before the network call finishes, the user navigates away (e.g., presses back).  
      ProfileViewController is deallocated.  
      The closure still runs, but self is now nil.  
      Because we used [weak self], it safely does nothing.  

**‚úÖ Use weak when:**  

      The closure might run after the view is gone.  
      You want to avoid crashes and handle self being nil.  

**‚úÖ Scenario 2: Using unowned self ‚Äî When View Will Not Be Deallocated**  

**üß† Example: Animation or Short-lived Closure**  
```swift
class WelcomeViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        animateLogo()
    }

    func animateLogo() {
        UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0) { [unowned self] in
            self.logo.alpha = 1.0
        }
    }
}
```
**üîç What Happens Here?**  

    The animation runs immediately after the view appears.  
    The view is guaranteed to be alive during the animation.  
    self will not be deallocated before the closure runs.  

**‚úÖ Use unowned when:**  

    The closure runs immediately or very soon.  
    You're sure self will still exist.  
    You want to avoid optional unwrapping (self?).
